# Port of the famous Zeus game

Can't find a way to make the [original Zeus game](https://github.com/SneManden/zeus) playable. Seems to be something missing. Anyhow, so I have started creating the game anew using a fresh Phaser + TypeScript template, using the old game as a reference. Might extend the game if I can manage to make it work.

Created using the [Phaser esbuild TypeScript Template](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-esbuild-ts).
