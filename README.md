# Port of the famous Zeus game

Can't find a way to make the [original Zeus game](https://github.com/SneManden/zeus) playable. Seems to be something missing. Anyhow, so I have started creating the game anew using a fresh Phaser + TypeScript template, using the old game as a reference. Might extend the game if I can manage to make it work.

Created using the [Phaser esbuild TypeScript Template](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-esbuild-ts).

## TODO

1. Implement Zeus' lightning zap,
1. Wake up bull after X time has passed,
1. Fix draft Game Over screen,
1. Fix draft Game Won screen,
1. Player can take hit debounce after life lost,
1. Sound effects!
1. Background music!
1. Make Zeus more aggressive as health gets low
1. Balance game play difficulty and play time
1. Fix/polish healthbar + player lifes,
1. Add bull running dust,
1. Bull juggle hit combo?
1. Other obstacles / enemies to counter?

## Known bugs

1. Double jump (happens if hitting space when overlapping bull in the air)
